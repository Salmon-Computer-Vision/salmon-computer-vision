If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Artifact and/or a Contribution incorporated within the Artifact constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License in connection with the Artifact shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.

Licensor and Contributor each have the right to grant the licenses above.

**Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION**

**4. Use-based restrictions.** The restrictions set forth in Attachment A are mandatory Use-based restrictions. Therefore You may not Use the Artifact in violation of such restrictions. You may Use the Artifact only subject to this License. You shall require all of Your users who use the Artifact or its Derivative to comply with the terms of this paragraph and only for the Permitted Purpose.

**6. Distribution and Redistribution**. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Artifact or its Derivatives in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:

1. Use-based restrictions in paragraph 4 MUST be included as a condition precedent to effect any type of legal agreement (e.g. a license) governing the use and/or distribution of the Artifact or its Derivatives, and You shall give such notice to any subsequent Third Party recipients;
2. You shall give any Third Party recipients of the Artifact or its Derivatives a copy of this License;

**12.** **Term and Termination.** The term of this License will commence upon the earlier of (a) Your acceptance of this License or (b) accessing the Artifact; and will continue in full force and effect until terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions herein.
